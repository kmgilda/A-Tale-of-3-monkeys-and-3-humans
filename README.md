# A-Tale-of-3-monkeys-and-3-humans

Problem Statement :

There are six characters in this story – Big Monkey, Two Small Monkeys and Three
humans.
	● All the six characters wish to reach the other bank of a River.
  ● At one time only two people can travel on the boat with the following condition - only a human
  or the big monkey can row the boat.
  ● If the monkeys are more in number that the humans at any side of the bank they will kill the humans.  
  ● In other words, the number of humans on each bank must always be equal or more
  than the number of monkeys.
